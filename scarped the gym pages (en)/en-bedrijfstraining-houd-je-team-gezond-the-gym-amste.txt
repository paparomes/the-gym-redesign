Types of Company Workouts

The Gym provides four ways to make your staff work out in a fun, casual way. A Company Workout can be a one-off event, but you can also choose a frequent Company Workout program to exercise regularly with your team. Our main goal with every Company Workout event is to create awareness among your staff about their physical and mental health and to put them to work as a team.

Looking for a fun and healthy way to upscale the team spirit within your company? Try our Team Building Session. During this work out session we will focus on exercising in ways that you have to work in teams. Including working together as well as competing each other.

Our Challenging Sports Event is perfect one day event for every employer who wants to make their employees sweat! It will increase your staff’s team building and provides them with that boost of positivity we all need from time to time.
