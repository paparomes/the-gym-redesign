We just can’t emphasize enough the importance of exercising with a personal trainer during pregnancy. Training whilst being pregnant will decrease the chances of gaining too much weight. An experienced nutritionist will set up a plan to make sure you get the matching diet you and your baby just need. Our training increases the body strength, to eliminate lower back pains. It is scientifically proven that pregnant women who exercise during pregnancy have a lower chance of premature birth, maternity poisoning and pregnancy diabetes. It has even been proven that women with pregnancy diabetes and a regular training schedule need less insuline.

Personal training at The Gym Amsterdam: for body and mind

Giving birth can change a lot: not only your body, but your entire life can be upside down when there’s a newborn baby in the house. Stress and a lack of sleep can change your mental state in a drastic way. At The Gym, we know from experience that exercising regurlarly can provide important mental benefits. During exercising, our body releases endorphines, also known as the ‘happy hormone’. Your level of stress will decrease the minute you start working out. This will immediately make your feel better and help you cope with your changing life situation.

Working out after giving birth

After giving birth, exercising is a healthy and important way to get your body back in shape. At The Gym we can provide you with an optimal schedule and a personal trainer to get your old physique back as fast as possible. We are also experienced in helping women with pelvic floor instability.
